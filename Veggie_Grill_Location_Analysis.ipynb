    "1. **High Attractiveness:** As you can see in the scatterplot above cluster 3 and 4 mark exceptional neighborhoods, which were therefore classified as \"high\" potential. Cluster 5 was also labeled as \"high\", since it has a significant amount of businesses present which means more employees looking for lunch opportunities.  \n",
    "2. **Medium Attractiveness:** Cluster 1, although higher in population than cluster 5 was classified as \"medium\" since it was lower in businesses located in these neighborhoods. The managementof **<span style=\"color:#75b239\">Veggie Grill</span>** prioritized number of businesses over population, since they see more potential to serve workers during lunch time, than the local population going out for lunch or dinner. Cluster 6 was also labeled as medium since it has an adequate amount of businesses and population.\n",
    "3. **Low Attractiveness:** The rest was classified as not attractive for opening the first restaurant."
